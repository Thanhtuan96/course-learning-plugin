# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** The learner builds real understanding by doing — not by reading Claude's code.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Plugin Scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Plugin Scaffold)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: in-progress
Last activity: 2026-03-06 — Completed 01-02 README.md

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 13%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All: Hybrid syllabus creation (Claude proposes, user reviews before start)
- All: NOTES.md as separate per-course flat file, not inline in COURSE.md
- All: Export is a user-triggered command, not automatic
- All: Notion MCP primary export target; Obsidian MCP as alternative
- All: Plugin structure chosen to enable hooks, dedicated agents, and slash commands
- [Phase 01-plugin-scaffold]: Pre-register all 14 professor:* commands in Phase 1 plugin.json manifest
- [Phase 01-plugin-scaffold]: Use professor: (English) prefix — not profesor: (old skill naming)
- [Phase 01-plugin-scaffold]: Hook event name PreCompact — needs verification before Phase 4 implementation
- [01-02]: Symlink install method (ln -s) with direct clone as alternative
- [01-02]: MCP setup sections marked optional (only needed for professor:export)
- [01-02]: Scope explicitly states Claude Code only — multi-platform deferred
- [Phase 02-professor-agent-and-core-commands]: All Socratic absolute rules defined in agents/professor.md only — zero duplication in command files
- [Phase 02-professor-agent-and-core-commands]: courses/ paths always resolve from cwd, not plugin install directory — Rule 11 added to absolute rules
- [Phase 02-professor-agent-and-core-commands]: professor:new-topic proposes syllabus inline in chat before writing files — user confirms first
- [Phase 02]: capstone-review.md gates explicitly on all sections Done before proceeding — matches SKILL.md spec
- [Phase 02]: Stub files include Phase number in coming-soon message (Phase 3 for note, Phase 5 for export)
- [Phase 02-professor-agent-and-core-commands]: hint.md defers layer tracking to agent conversation history — no layer rules in the command file
- [Phase 02-professor-agent-and-core-commands]: stuck.md and quiz.md open with AskUserQuestion per locked decisions in 02-CONTEXT.md
- [Phase 02-professor-agent-and-core-commands]: Command files are thin routing stubs — all Socratic behavior rules remain exclusively in agents/professor.md
- [Phase 02-professor-agent-and-core-commands]: new-topic inline syllabus proposal confirmed before COURSE.md and CAPSTONE.md are written simultaneously

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- HOK: PreCompact hook depends on Claude Code hook API — verify exact event name before implementing Phase 4
- EXP: Obsidian MCP server must be present in user workspace for export to succeed — covered in README scope (Phase 5)
