# Roadmap: Course Learning Plugin

## Overview

Five phases transform the existing professor-skill-v3 into a full Claude Code plugin. The scaffold comes first to establish the target structure, then the professor agent is packaged with all its course commands, then personal notes and the PreCompact session-save hook are layered on, and finally the Notion/Obsidian export pipeline completes the knowledge-retention story.

v1.1 adds Git Worktree-based courses - each technology learned gets its own git worktree, with learning files alongside the user's project code.

## Phases

**Goal:** Automatically create exercise files when professor:next is called, instead of making users create files manually. Exercise files are templates with comments, not working code.
**Requirements**: EXER-01, EXER-02, EXER-03, EXER-04
**Depends on:** Phase 7
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
**Status:** Complete (2026-03-08)

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Auto-create exercise files on professor:next

### Phase 9: Backend Foundation

**Depends on:** Phase 8

**Requirements:** WEB-01, WEB-02, WEB-03, WEB-04, WEB-05, WEB-06, WEB-07, WEB-08

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Express server starts on configurable port (default 3000) when `npm run web` is executed
2. GET `/api/courses` returns JSON array of courses with slug, name, and lastActive fields
3. GET `/api/courses/:slug/:file` returns raw content of COURSE.md, LECTURE.md, NOTES.md, or CAPSTONE.md
4. POST `/api/chat` with message accepts request and initiates SSE stream to client
5. Chat API loads behavioral rules from `agents/professor.md` for Socratic consistency
6. Chat API includes relevant course context (current lecture, progress) in Claude requests
7. WebSocket server runs alongside HTTP server and accepts client connections
8. POST `/api/notify` broadcasts "lecture-updated" event to all connected WebSocket clients

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01-PLAN.md — Implement Express backend with course API, chat API (SSE), and WebSocket server

### Phase 10: Client Components

**Goal:** React client with split-pane layout, lecture panel with markdown rendering, chat panel with streaming and context-aware command pills.

**Depends on:** Phase 9

**Requirements:** WEB-09, WEB-10, WEB-11, WEB-12, WEB-13, WEB-14, WEB-15, WEB-16, WEB-22

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Browser displays two-panel layout: lecture panel (left ~40%) and chat panel (right ~60%)
2. LecturePanel renders LECTURE.md content as formatted markdown with syntax-highlighted code blocks
3. LecturePanel automatically fetches new content when WebSocket receives "lecture-updated" event
4. ChatPanel displays streaming Claude responses character-by-character as they arrive via SSE
5. ChatPanel shows command pills (buttons) above or below chat input
6. Command pills update based on current learning phase: idle shows new-topic, lecture shows hint/review/quiz, exercise shows hint/stuck/review, review shows done/hint
7. Top bar displays course selector dropdown listing all available courses
8. Top bar shows current course name and last active timestamp as progress indicator
9. All markdown rendered anywhere in the UI is sanitized with DOMPurify to prevent XSS attacks

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01-PLAN.md — Implement React client with LecturePanel, ChatPanel, WebSocket hook, and DOMPurify sanitization

---

### Phase 11: Integration

**Goal:** CLI web command launches server, production build creates optimized bundle, Express serves static files in production mode.

**Depends on:** Phase 10

**Requirements:** WEB-17, WEB-18, WEB-19, WEB-20, WEB-21

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Running `npx course-professor web` in CLI starts the Express server and opens web UI
2. `npx course-professor web 8080` starts server on port 8080 instead of default 3000
3. Web UI reads and writes to the same `courses/` directory that the CLI uses (no separate data store)
4. Running `npm run build` in project root creates optimized React bundle in `client/dist/`
5. When NODE_ENV=production, Express serves static React build from `client/dist/` instead of proxying to Vite dev server

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01-PLAN.md — Implement CLI web command, production build, and static file serving

### Phase 12: mcp.json for tool that needed in this source (notion, obsidian, ....) document it

**Goal:** [To be planned]
**Requirements**: TBD
**Depends on:** Phase 11
