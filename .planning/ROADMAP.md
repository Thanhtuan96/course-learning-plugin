# Roadmap: Course Learning Plugin

## Overview

Five phases transform the existing professor-skill-v3 into a full Claude Code plugin. The scaffold comes first to establish the target structure, then the professor agent is packaged with all its course commands, then personal notes and the PreCompact session-save hook are layered on, and finally the Notion/Obsidian export pipeline completes the knowledge-retention story.

v1.1 adds agent support (Cursor), agent specialization, research-enhanced hints, and MCP documentation.

v2.0 adds Local Web UI (React + Express), Retention Layer (spaced repetition, flashcards, streaks), and Sharing & Templates (course template export/import).

## Phases

**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: HOK-01, HOK-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When context approaches the compression threshold, the user sees a visible token-limit warning message before the reset occurs
  2. The active section, progress, and key session state are written to COURSE.md before context is compressed, so resuming the course picks up where the user left off
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Implement PreCompact hook with token warning display and COURSE.md session-state auto-save

### Phase 5: Export Feature

  5. Exercises folder is left behind (user has code locally)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Implement professor:archive command with course archive and exercises handling

### Phase 7: Git Worktree Courses

**Goal:** Each technology learned = one git worktree. User's code lives in the worktree alongside learning files. When archived, learning context is preserved to `.course_archive/` before worktree is cleaned up.
**Depends on:** Phase 6
**Requirements**: WORK-01, WORK-02, WORK-03, WORK-04, ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, FILE-01, FILE-02, FILE-03, FILE-04, CMD-15, CMD-16, CMD-17

  3. User can list all existing learning worktrees
  4. User can switch between learning worktrees
  5. Archiving copies learning files to `.course_archive/{slug}/` before removing worktree
  6. User's code remains in worktree (not deleted with the worktree)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Implement git worktree-based course structure and worktree management

### Phase 8: Auto-create Exercise Files

**Goal:** Automatically create exercise files when professor:next is called, instead of making users create files manually. Exercise files are templates with comments, not working code.
**Requirements**: EXER-01, EXER-02, EXER-03, EXER-04
**Depends on:** Phase 7
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
**Status:** Complete (2026-03-08)

**Depends on:** Phase 9

**Requirements:** AGT-01

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Each specialized agent has a clear focus area (e.g., math-agent, marketing-agent, researcher-agent)
2. Agents can delegate to other agents when needed
3. Agents have appropriate tools for their domain

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Create researcher agent and register in plugin.json
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Add delegation from professor to researcher agent + CLI support
- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — Create researcher agent templates

---

### Phase 11: Research-Enhanced Hints

**Goal:** Enhance professor:hint and professor:stuck commands to provide keywords for googling or research, plus useful conferences/resources to help users figure out solutions themselves.

**Depends on:** Phase 10

**Requirements:** TBD

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Hints include relevant search keywords
2. Hints suggest useful conferences, tutorials, or documentation
3. Research suggestions are contextual to the current learning topic
4. Static fallback available when live research unavailable

**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Enhance hint and stuck commands with research keywords

---

### Phase 12: MCP Documentation

**Depends on:** Phase 12

**Requirements:** WEB-09, WEB-10, WEB-11, WEB-12, WEB-13, WEB-14, WEB-15, WEB-16, WEB-22

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Browser displays two-panel layout: lecture panel (left ~40%) and chat panel (right ~60%)
2. LecturePanel renders LECTURE.md content as formatted markdown with syntax-highlighted code blocks
3. LecturePanel automatically fetches new content when WebSocket receives "lecture-updated" event
4. ChatPanel displays streaming Claude responses character-by-character as they arrive via SSE
5. ChatPanel shows command pills (buttons) above or below chat input
6. Command pills update based on current learning phase: idle shows new-topic, lecture shows hint/review/quiz, exercise shows hint/stuck/review, review shows done/hint
7. Top bar displays course selector dropdown listing all available courses
8. Top bar shows current course name and last active timestamp as progress indicator
9. All markdown rendered anywhere in the UI is sanitized with DOMPurify to prevent XSS attacks

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Set up React client project infrastructure with Vite, dependencies, CSS theme, API client, and markdown utilities
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — Implement all React components (Header, SplitPane, LecturePanel, ChatPanel, CommandPills, MobileTabSwitcher), hooks (useWebSocket, useSSE), and integrate with backend

---

### Phase 14: Integration

**Goal:** CLI web command launches server, production build creates optimized bundle, Express serves static files in production mode.

**Depends on:** Phase 13

**Requirements:** WEB-17, WEB-18, WEB-19, WEB-20, WEB-21

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Running `npx course-professor web` in CLI starts the Express server and opens web UI
2. `npx course-professor web 8080` starts server on port 8080 instead of default 3000
3. Web UI reads and writes to the same `courses/` directory that the CLI uses (no separate data store)
4. Running `npm run build` in project root creates optimized React bundle in `client/dist/`
5. When NODE_ENV=production, Express serves static React build from `client/dist/` instead of proxying to Vite dev server

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Implement CLI web command, production build, and static file serving

### Phase 15: Retention Layer

**Goal:** Prevent learners from forgetting completed content through spaced repetition scheduling, interactive recall sessions, streak tracking, and time-per-section logging — all stored in plain Markdown with no external plugin dependencies.

**Depends on:** Phase 14

**Requirements:** RET-01, RET-02, RET-03, RET-04, RET-05

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. `courses/{slug}/SCHEDULE.md` is auto-created when `professor:done` completes a section, containing a spaced repetition queue and flashcard set for that section
2. `professor:recall` runs an interactive recall session: shows due sections, asks 3 Socratic questions per section, user self-rates (clear/fuzzy/forgot), updates SCHEDULE.md with next scheduled date
3. `professor:schedule` displays a read-only dashboard of overdue, due-today, and upcoming reviews
4. Session start auto-checks SCHEDULE.md and displays recall count + streak if items are due
5. Streak (days active) and time-per-section are tracked in COURSE.md and visible in `professor:progress`
6. `professor:export` includes SCHEDULE.md data — flashcards exported as plain Q/A table to Notion; Markdown as-is to Obsidian

**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 15 to break down)

---

### Phase 16: Sharing and Templates

**Goal:** Enable course syllabus sharing via exportable template files and one-command template import, so instructors and community members can share learning paths without sharing personal progress or notes.

**Depends on:** Phase 15

**Requirements:** SHR-01, SHR-02, SHR-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. `professor:template-export` creates `courses/{slug}/TEMPLATE.md` containing only course structure (sections, objectives, capstone brief) — no personal data (notes, progress, answers, dates)
2. `professor:template-import <path>` reads a TEMPLATE.md file and creates a new course with pre-built syllabus; user still runs `professor:next` to generate lectures
3. Exported template is valid Markdown readable without any tool and importable by any Professor installation

**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 16 to break down)

**Requirements**: TBD
**Depends on:** Phase 16
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 17 to break down)
