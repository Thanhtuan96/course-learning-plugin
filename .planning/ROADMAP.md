# Roadmap: Course Learning Plugin

## Overview

Five phases transform the existing professor-skill-v3 into a full Claude Code plugin. The scaffold comes first to establish the target structure, then the professor agent is packaged with all its course commands, then personal notes and the PreCompact session-save hook are layered on, and finally the Notion/Obsidian export pipeline completes the knowledge-retention story.

v1.1 adds Git Worktree-based courses - each technology learned gets its own git worktree, with learning files alongside the user's project code.

v2.0 adds agent specialization, research-enhanced hints, and MCP documentation.

## Phases

**Goal:** Allow technical learners to archive completed courses with full context (notes, summary, syllabus) while leaving code exercises behind, plus improve context management for technical courses
**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Course folder can include `exercises/` subfolder for code artifacts
  2. User can run `professor:archive` after course completion to archive learning context
  3. Archive creates `.course_archive/{slug}/` with COURSE.md, NOTES.md, CAPSTONE.md, and SUMMARY.md (comprehensive retrospective)

  5. Exercises folder is left behind (user has code locally)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Implement professor:archive command with course archive and exercises handling

### Phase 7: Git Worktree Courses

**Goal:** Each technology learned = one git worktree. User's code lives in the worktree alongside learning files. When archived, learning context is preserved to `.course_archive/` before worktree is cleaned up.
**Depends on:** Phase 6
**Requirements**: WORK-01, WORK-02, WORK-03, WORK-04, ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, FILE-01, FILE-02, FILE-03, FILE-04, CMD-15, CMD-16, CMD-17

  2. Learning files (COURSE.md, NOTES.md, CAPSTONE.md) live in worktree root alongside project code
  3. User can list all existing learning worktrees
  4. User can switch between learning worktrees
  5. Archiving copies learning files to `.course_archive/{slug}/` before removing worktree
  6. User's code remains in worktree (not deleted with the worktree)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Implement git worktree-based course structure and worktree management

### Phase 8: Auto-create Exercise Files

**Goal:** Automatically create exercise files when professor:next is called, instead of making users create files manually. Exercise files are templates with comments, not working code.
**Requirements**: EXER-01, EXER-02, EXER-03, EXER-04
**Depends on:** Phase 7
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
**Status:** Complete (2026-03-08)

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Auto-create exercise files on professor:next

### Phase 9: Backend Foundation

**Goal:** Express server running with working course API, chat API (SSE), and WebSocket server for real-time lecture updates.

**Depends on:** Phase 8

**Requirements:** WEB-01, WEB-02, WEB-03, WEB-04, WEB-05, WEB-06, WEB-07, WEB-08

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Express server starts on configurable port (default 3000) when `npm run web` is executed
2. GET `/api/courses` returns JSON array of courses with slug, name, and lastActive fields
3. GET `/api/courses/:slug/:file` returns raw content of COURSE.md, LECTURE.md, NOTES.md, or CAPSTONE.md
4. POST `/api/chat` with message accepts request and initiates SSE stream to client
5. Chat API loads behavioral rules from `agents/professor.md` for Socratic consistency
6. Chat API includes relevant course context (current lecture, progress) in Claude requests
7. WebSocket server runs alongside HTTP server and accepts client connections
8. POST `/api/notify` broadcasts "lecture-updated" event to all connected WebSocket clients

**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01-PLAN.md — Implement Express backend with course API, chat API (SSE), and WebSocket server

### Phase 10: Agent Specialization

**Goal:** Improve and separate agents into specific agent fields (math, marketing, sales, coaching, bookkeeper, researcher, etc.). Let each agent focus on one job and do it well. Agents can use tools or call other agents.

**Depends on:** Phase 9

**Requirements:** TBD

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Each specialized agent has a clear focus area (e.g., math-agent, marketing-agent, researcher-agent)
2. Agents can delegate to other agents when needed
3. Agents have appropriate tools for their domain

**Plans:** To be planned

---

### Phase 11: Research-Enhanced Hints

**Goal:** Enhance professor:hint and professor:stuck commands to provide keywords for googling or research, plus useful conferences/resources to help users figure out solutions themselves.

**Depends on:** Phase 10

**Requirements:** TBD

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Hints include relevant search keywords
2. Hints suggest useful conferences, tutorials, or documentation
3. Research suggestions are contextual to the current learning topic

**Plans:** To be planned

---

### Phase 12: MCP Documentation

**Goal:** Document mcp.json configuration for tools needed in this project (notion, obsidian, etc.)

**Depends on:** Phase 11

**Requirements:** TBD

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. mcp.json is documented with all required tools
2. Notion MCP configuration is documented
3. Obsidian MCP configuration is documented

**Plans:** To be planned
